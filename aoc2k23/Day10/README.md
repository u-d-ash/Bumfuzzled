### Day 10

* Tough one today !
* I scratched my head for 30 mins in order to get an idea of how to model this thing !
* For first part, traversed through the loop and the answer was pathlength/2
* The second part, looked very difficult at first, but was easy to implement after getting the correct deduction !

**However, I didn't get the exact answer for the second part. Just tried some values around it and got lucky !**

Will have to fix that !
